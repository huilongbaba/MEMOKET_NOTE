"""Group topics into clusters, so writing can retrieve at a coarser grain.

**The problem, measured.** The writing codebook has 196 topics with a median
of 10 facts each and 51% at or below 10; the original codebook has 117 with a
median of 35 and only 21% at or below 10. Fine topics are what makes
question-answering precise, and they are exactly what makes writing repeat
itself: a section's worth of material is spread across six topics, retrieval
returns one of them, and the round says the same thing again from a new angle.

This is a real trade-off, not a bug. GraphRAG's answer is the one taken here:
**keep the fine topics for retrieval and build a coarse layer on top of
them.** Facts stay where they are; clusters are a view.

**Why co-occurrence and not the names.** The obvious cheap grouping is the
shared prefix -- ``product_design``, ``product_strategy``, ``product_*``.
Measured on the real codebook it barely moves anything: 196 topics collapse
to 114 prefixes, the median goes from 10 to 12.5, and 46% are still at or
below 10, because 77 prefixes have exactly one topic. The fragmentation is
semantic, not lexical: ``international_school_admissions``, ``english_*`` and
``career_*`` are one subject and share no prefix.

Topics that keep turning up in the same conversations, on the other hand, do
belong together. On the real data the top pairs by overlap are
``property_sale ~ property_rental``, ``academic_performance ~
education_abroad``, and ``odi_application ~ offshore_fundraising ~
red_chip_architecture`` -- all correct, all invisible to prefix matching.

**No model call and no graph database.** Deterministic all the way through,
including tie-breaking, so the same codebook always produces the same
clusters and a change in them means the data changed.
