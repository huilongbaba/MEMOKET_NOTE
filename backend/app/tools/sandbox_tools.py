"""Running a skill's script -- as a tool, not as a separate code path.

Registering it here rather than calling the sandbox directly from the harness
is the whole design. A tool inherits, for free:

* **authorisation** -- ``group="skill_script"``, so a Mode has to ask for it
* **provenance** -- the result lands in ToolTrace, so the UI can show what ran
* **budget** -- ``max_calls_per_round`` caps how often
* **isolation** -- a failure is one failed tool call, not a dead run

The sandbox answers "is it safe to run". Everything else -- may it run, what
ran, does the output count -- is answered by machinery that already exists.
