"""Turn each round's observations into the next round's run parameters.

Everything a round produces -- the scores, the scorer's own wording, how many
tools were called, how many facts came back, whether revisions applied -- was
being read once and thrown away. This is the feedback path that was missing:
the run reads its own behaviour and changes how it runs.

It also reads *across* runs. ``recent()`` had an implementation and no
callers, so a note that failed the same way three times started the fourth
attempt with exactly the settings that failed before.
