"""Accumulate material across rounds, and trim it -- welded together.

Two separate bugs came out of doing only one half:

* **Reset per round.** The output accumulates but the material didn't, so
  round 3's scoring judged the whole piece using only round 3's material.
  This shipped in note_harness, then again in compose_block, then sat
  undiscovered in writing_plan (where measurements later showed its rounds
  losing 0.278 on average while the other two held steady).
* **No ceiling.** Three separate accumulators grew without bound.

Welding them means there is no way to write "accumulate but don't trim".
