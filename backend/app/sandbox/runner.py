"""Executing one script inside the cage.

Platform-specific because the kernel primitives are: Seatbelt on macOS,
bubblewrap on Linux. Same approach Claude Code takes, for the same reason --
enforcement below the application means a clever script cannot argue its way
past it.

**When neither is available the answer is no.** Falling back to "run it
anyway, unconfined" would turn a security boundary into a suggestion, and the
failure would be silent on exactly the machines that need it most.

    """A Seatbelt policy: allow by default, then deny what must not be reached.

    The intended shape was ``(deny default)`` with named allowances -- a true
    allow-list. It does not work: CPython under deny-default aborts during
    interpreter startup (SIGABRT, no diagnostic), and getting it to boot means
    enumerating every path, mach service and sysctl the interpreter touches.
    That enumeration is as open-ended as the deny-lists this module distrusts
    elsewhere. A blanket ``(deny file-read-data)`` with an allow-list fails the
    same way, even when the list already covers every directory the process is
    known to open.

    What does work, and what is written below, is allow-default plus denial of
    whole regions:

      * the network, at every level and for every skill
      * writing anywhere but the scratch directory (and, at FILES level, the
        one output path the user chose)
      * reading any region where this machine's *data* lives -- home
        directories, mounted volumes, the temp trees -- with the interpreter's
        own installation and the skill's own directory punched back out

    So a script can still read ``/usr`` and ``/System``. It cannot read the
    knowledge base, the user's notes, another skill's files, or anything under
    ``$HOME``, because all of those are inside the denied regions. That is a
    weaker guarantee than the Linux path, where bubblewrap builds a fresh
    mount namespace that simply does not contain the rest of the disk; the
    asymmetry is real and is not worth papering over.
