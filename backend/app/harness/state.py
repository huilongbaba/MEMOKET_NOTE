"""Everything one run carries.

**One State per run.** That is the whole answer to concurrency (R9): several
`/` commands can run against the same note at once, each with its own State,
and nothing crosses over.

It is also the answer to a bug that shipped four times: "the accumulated
thing" and "the per-round thing" used to both be locals in one giant
generator, distinguished only by indentation, so it was easy to reset the
wrong one. Here the accumulated things are fields on an object created
outside the loop -- the mistake is no longer expressible.
