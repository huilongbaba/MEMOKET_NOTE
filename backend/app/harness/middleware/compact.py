"""Shrink the continuation prompt when the piece gets long.

**Only the continuation prompt.** Revision and scoring keep reading the full
text: both are hunting for drift and repetition *across* the whole piece, and
compacting hides exactly what they're looking for. That's why this writes to
``bag`` instead of touching ``st.content``.

Not in BASE -- only long-form runs into the limit. Block generation produces
a few hundred characters.
