"""Skill tools: how the model reaches level 2 and 3 of progressive disclosure.

The system prompt carries every skill's name and description (~100 tokens
each). When the model judges one relevant it calls ``load_skill``; if that
body points at a bundled file it calls ``read_skill_ref``. Nothing else is in
context until it asks.

Putting these behind tools rather than a bespoke code path is deliberate:
they then inherit authorisation (``group="skill"``), provenance (results land
in ToolTrace, so TapProvenance can show what was consulted), per-round call
caps, and error isolation -- all of it for free.
