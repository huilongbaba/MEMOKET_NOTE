"""Skills: standard SKILL.md directories on disk, our config in the database.

The format is Agent Skills' ``SKILL.md`` and we follow it exactly -- no extra
frontmatter keys. The spec allows two required fields and nothing else:

    name         <=64 chars, lowercase letters / digits / hyphens only
    description  non-empty, <=1024 chars, must say both what it does and
                 when to use it (this is what the model matches against)

Our own settings -- which scopes a skill applies to, whether it's enabled,
what sandbox level the user granted -- deliberately do **not** live in that
file. Two reasons:

1. The spec has no extension mechanism. Inventing keys makes a dialect, and
   then third-party skills don't drop in and ours don't travel.
2. They aren't properties of the skill anyway. Which scopes it applies to is
   how *we* use it -- one user may want it for drafting, another for
   polishing. Sandbox permission is something the user *grants*; an app
   doesn't get to declare it has camera access.

So: content on disk, untouched; configuration in ``skill_config``.
