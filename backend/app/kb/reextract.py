"""Rebuild the writing codebook from the source one, and keep it caught up.

**Two codebooks, on purpose.** The library's own extraction prompt opens with
"Extract durable, atomic structured facts" -- built so an answer can be
recalled and located later. Writing wants the opposite: self-contained
statements that carry the cause and the constraint, with the several mentions
of one thing already merged and the speaker labels gone. Measured on the
original codebook, 16% of its 20k facts are unusable for writing outright and
most of the rest are still question-answering shaped.

So the writing facts go to ``{user}-rewrite`` and the original is never
touched. Nothing here writes to the source.

**A whole meeting at a time.** This matters more than the prompt change. On
ingestion a meeting is cut into ~1125-character chunks and each chunk is
extracted alone -- 201 meetings became 2429 chunks, a median of 7 per meeting
and up to 64. An extractor seeing a thousand characters cannot merge the
several mentions of one decision or attach the reason to it, because those
are usually in a different chunk. It can only produce fragments. Regrouping
by meeting is what lets it produce something a writer can use.

**Resumable because it has to be.** This ran as a batch script that was meant
to be stopped and inspected between batches, and it was: the writing codebook
sat unfinished with no ordinary way to catch it up. KITE refuses a duplicate
``session_id`` without spending a model call, so re-running is already free
and idempotent; what was missing was something that finds the gap.
