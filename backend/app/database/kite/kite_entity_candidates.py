"""Replaces KITE's "KNOWN ENTITIES" prompt hint with a session-relevant
candidate list, instead of an alphabetically-first-80 slice of the whole
vocabulary.

Root cause (verified against terrence's real codebook, 1958 entities):
memoket_kite.pipeline.extract._extract_facts_with_cache() builds this hint as
``", ".join(sorted(vocabulary.entities)[:80])``. 105 of those 1958 entities
are numeric-looking noise ("100美元", "10号", "2月10号", ...) -- digits sort
before letters, so those 105 alone fill the entire 80-slot window. Zero real
named entities ever reach the model. core/vocab.py's register_entity() has no
fuzzy-matching safety net of its own by design (exact normalized-string match
against known codes/aliases, nothing else -- see its module docstring, "pure
symbolic layer, no LLM"); the KNOWN ENTITIES hint is the ONLY mechanism that
lets the model reuse an existing code instead of inventing a new one. With
that hint permanently starved, it has never worked for this vocabulary: the
corpus's single most-mentioned entity, "memoket" itself, has fragmented into
61 separate codes (memocat, memocad, memokit, memokai, memo_kid, ...).

There is no override parameter for this -- unlike EXTRACT_PROMPT (see
kite_extract_profile.py, which patches a template the profile owns), the
entities= value is computed INLINE inside _extract_facts_with_cache(), not
read from anything a profile controls. The only way to change it without
forking the package is to replace that function's module binding -- same
technique kite_extract_profile.py uses for DEFAULT_MEMORY_PROFILE, just at a
bigger surface: this file carries a full copy of _extract_facts_with_cache()
(verified against memoket_kite==0.1.0) with exactly one line changed --
entities= now calls _coarse_entity_candidates() instead of the alphabetical
slice. Everything else (caching, fingerprinting, logging) delegates straight
to the real helpers in memoket_kite.pipeline.extract, unchanged. install()
checks the installed version and refuses to patch silently if it drifts from
what this copy was verified against -- this needs a manual re-diff against
the new _extract_facts_with_cache() before bumping _VERIFIED_AGAINST.

_coarse_entity_candidates() itself is deliberately cheap and approximate (no
LLM call before every extraction -- this runs once per chunk, thousands of
times for a full-corpus ingest): character-bigram overlap between each
entity's known surface forms (code, original name, aliases) and this
session's own dialogue text, with an exact-substring match scored as a
guaranteed top hit. This is a *candidate filter* for the prompt hint, not a
matching decision -- the model still has to recognize and copy the code; this
just gives it a real chance to see the right one instead of a wall of prices
and dates.
