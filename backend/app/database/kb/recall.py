"""Retrieval at cluster grain, for writing.

Question-answering wants the narrowest topic that answers the question.
Writing wants everything about a subject at once: a section built from six
facts scattered over six sibling topics has nothing to say the second time
it is asked to write about that subject, so it says the first thing again in
different words -- which is what ``non_repetition`` has been measuring all
along.

So the same codebook is read two ways. ``kite_memory.recall`` stays exactly
as it is and keeps answering questions; this walks out from its hits into
the surrounding cluster and brings back the rest of the subject.

**Seeding still goes through the ordinary recall.** The clusters decide how
far to walk, never where to start -- a wrong cluster would otherwise be able
to replace the query's own answer instead of merely extending it.
