"""Every type a harness is built from, in one file.

Nothing here knows about writing, notes, or KITE. A harness is assembled by
picking a ``Mode`` and supplying three callbacks; the loop and the middleware
chain do the rest.

Two groups, and they used to live apart:

* **The framework**: ``Mode`` (what this run wants), ``Hooks`` (the three
  callbacks each harness writes), ``Middleware`` (capabilities), ``Check`` /
  ``Verdict`` (the code-judged half of 判据), ``StopCondition``.
* **Scoring**: ``Dimension`` / ``DimensionScore`` / ``Evaluation`` -- the
  model-judged half. These were in a separate installable package
  (``writer_harness``) built to be open-sourced one day. It had exactly one
  consumer, and the cost of the extra concept was that nobody could tell
  what it was. ``Mode.dims`` is a ``tuple[Dimension, ...]`` and ``State.ev``
  is an ``Evaluation`` -- they were always framework types, so they live
  with the rest of them now.

    there, one written implementation is shared by every harness; here, every

    on and hooks cannot -- an empty contract has no default to give.
